Domain: Data Analytics

Duration: 5th December 2024 to 5th January 2025

Overview of the Project:  
The "Stock Market Analysis and Prediction" task aims to analyze historical stock market data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in stock prices during my internship in CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS. It utilizes advanced statistical and machine learning techniques such as ARIMA and LSTM to perform time series analysis and predict future stock prices. This project demonstrates the practical application of data science in financial market analysis and provides actionable insights for investors.


Key Activities:  
1. Data Collection:  
   - Fetch historical stock data using yfinance for a specified time range.
   
2. Data Preprocessing:  
   - Handle missing values using forward-fill techniques.  
   - Normalize the data to prepare it for machine learning models.

3. Data Visualization:  
   - Visualize historical closing prices to understand price trends over time.  
   - Perform seasonal decomposition to analyze trends, seasonal effects, and residuals.

4. ARIMA Modeling:  
   - Apply the ARIMA model for short-term forecasting of stock prices based on historical patterns.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's accuracy.

5. LSTM Modeling:  
   - Prepare data for sequence modeling with LSTM by creating datasets with look-back periods.  
   - Build, train, and evaluate an LSTM model for long-term stock price prediction.

6. Evaluation and Visualization:  
   - Compare actual and predicted stock prices for both ARIMA and LSTM models.  
   - Visualize the predictions to understand the model's performance.
